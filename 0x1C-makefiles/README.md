# Readme file for Understanding Make and Makefiles

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding `make` and `Makefiles`.

## What are make and Makefiles?

`make` is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called `Makefiles` which specify how to derive the target program.

## When, why and how to use Makefiles

`Makefiles` are used when you have a large and/or complex source code and you want to simplify the compilation process. They are used to automate the build process and manage dependencies, ensuring that only the necessary parts of the code are recompiled.

## What are rules and how to set and use them

In a `Makefile`, a rule relates a target to its prerequisites and provides a recipe to update the target if it is out of date with respect to the prerequisites.

## What are explicit and implicit rules

Explicit rules are rules that are defined for specific targets. Implicit rules are defined for a class of targets that match a certain pattern.

## What are the most common / useful rules

The most common rules in a `Makefile` include all, clean, install, and run. The 'all' rule compiles all your code. The 'clean' rule removes all files generated by the makefile. The 'install' rule copies files to their destination directory. The 'run' rule executes the compiled program.

## What are variables and how to set and use them

Variables in `Makefiles` are a way to simplify and centralize the management of compiler flags, directories, filenames, or any other data that is used in multiple places in the makefile.
