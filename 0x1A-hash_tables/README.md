## Introduction
This repository focuses on the concept of hash tables and hash functions, their workings, advantages, drawbacks, and common use cases.

## Hash Function
A **hash function** is a special kind of function used in computing to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The output of a hash function, known as a hash code or simply a hash, is typically used as an index to quickly locate an item in a data structure such as a hash table.

### What Makes a Good Hash Function
A good hash function has the following properties:
- **Deterministic**: For a given input, the function always produces the same output.
- **Fast to compute the hash value**: The function should be capable of returning the hash value in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Uniform distribution**: The function should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table to minimize collisions.
- **Less likely to produce collisions**: While all hash functions have the potential for collision, a good hash function minimizes this risk.

## Hash Table
A **hash table** is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

### How Hash Tables Work
The key is processed through a hash function, producing a hash code, which is then used as an index to access the array. If the index already contains a value, a collision is said to have occurred (see [Collision Handling](#collision-handling)).

## Collision Handling
A **collision** occurs when two different keys hash to the same index in a hash table. There are several strategies for handling collisions:

- **Chaining (Open Hashing)**: Each slot in the hash table points to a linked list of elements that hash to the same slot.
- **Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)**: All elements are stored directly in the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, we find the next empty slot or address in the hash table by probing.

## Advantages and Drawbacks
**Advantages**:
- **Efficient data access**: Hash tables allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data.
- **Flexible keys**: Unlike arrays, hash tables can use flexible data types for keys.

**Drawbacks**:
- **Space complexity**: Hash tables require more memory than other data structures.
- **Collisions**: While methods exist to handle collisions, they can impact performance.

## Use Cases
Hash tables are commonly used in many applications such as:
- **Database indexing**: Hash tables can be used to index large amounts of data. A unique key is assigned to each record which makes it faster to retrieve.
- **Caching**: Hash tables can be used to store and quickly retrieve data from a cache.
- **Associative Arrays**: Hash tables can implement associative arrays (also known as maps or dictionaries) which allow you to store and retrieve data with a non-numeric key.
